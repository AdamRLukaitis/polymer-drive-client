This is a sample code for the Google IO 2014 codelab 
"Polymer: Build a Material Design Mobile Web App with Paper Elements".

Codelab instructions: http://io2014codelabs.appspot.com/static/codelabs/polymer-build-mobile/

***
This code sample uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage code dependencies. Plese run 

    $ bower install

in each directory you wish to test before running the sample in the browser.
***

***
Polymer requires files to be served over HTTP server rather than as local files. 
E.g. if you have python (2.x) installed, run

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

(or another server of your choice) to view the sample in the browser.
